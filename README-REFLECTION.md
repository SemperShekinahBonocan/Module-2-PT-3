"What was the most challenging part of working with variables and data types in Java? How did you overcome it?"
My answer: As a beginner Java coder, something that challenged me was learning the correct formulas for variables and data types to function in Java. I overcame it by making sure to check each and everytime I test a new code,
and researching how to do it online. I have also tried using AI as a way to break it down for me, and to help me get references while fact checking and fixing the code until it is stable and functional. Just like my experiences
trying HTML and C+, being a first-time coder in Java made me realize how much I have to focus and review each line of code without merely glossing it over, and running it everytime so that I know it is working as intended.
